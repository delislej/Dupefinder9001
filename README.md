# Dupefinder9001
duplicate finder

This is my first major project in python using PYQT5 for a GUI. I am hoping to make it both a GUI and CLI application.

run dupefinder.py for GUI
CLI usage: run as python CLI with | dupefinder.py infolder outfolder #ofcores | (entering more than your max cores, or an invalid number will set core count to 1)

packages used: PyQt5, PyQt5.QtCore, glob, hashlib, shutil, time, multiprocessing, sys, math
